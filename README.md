# GreatCircleDistance
This Python based Terminal application computes the great circle distance between two points on the Earth's surface using the haversine formula.

How it works:
1. You will require the Latitude and Longitude values of two(2) locations on Earth, strictly in Decimal Degree format.
2. For test purposes you are welcome to use the following random location generator (https://perchance.org/geographic-location)
3. Enter the values accordingly when prompted to do so

If you would like to convert the Kilometre distance to any other unit of measurement I highly recommend you check out this awesome unit converter by Bearded-Viking https://github.com/Bearded-Viking/UnitConverter

Enjoy!

NB: I will continue to improve the application.
